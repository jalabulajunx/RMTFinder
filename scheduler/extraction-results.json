The continual movement of bodily fluids is also essential for maintaining well being. When this is not working, a state of congestion of circulation develops. This impairs the delivery of oxygen and nutrients and removal of waste products from the tissues which creates discomfort and pain. This often may be felt in an area not that closely associated to the original problem.\r\nOsteopathic practitioners use specialized skills to identify restrictions and tensions of the tissues in your body. Their specific techniques ease those restrictions, which allows for normal physiology to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking to book an appointment for today?  Call the spa for availability ",

The ultimate intention of Craniosacral Therapy is to release these adhesions and improve our alignment, allowing the entire body to self correct.  Our CST has a direct impact on our central nervous system, the “motherboard” for the entire body and ALL of its systems. When this system is compromised the performance of nearly every other system in the body can be compromised as well, including even digestion! In turn, this system when balanced will affect every other system within the body, helping to balance them as well. \r\nCST naturally eliminates pain and stress, strengthens your resistance to disease, and enhances your health and well-being. \r\n\r\nCST is a very light touch approach that can create dramatic improvements in your life. It releases tensions deep in your body to relieve pain and dysfunction and improve whole body health and performance. \r\n\r\nBook your appointment today. ",

It will also balance the body, which in turn will help to heal and balance every system in the body. \r\n\r\nThe 10 step protocol is a once over, \r\nA whole body unwinding. The main connection points for the fascial system are released as well as a recipe of releases for the head. If you’ve ever lived….. broken a bone, sprained an ankle, accidents, birth trauma….

Similar to how veins and capillaries work to move blood through the circulatory system, the lymphatic system is a network of vessels that moves lymph from tissues to the bloodstream. Lymph is made of white blood cells that attack bacteria within the blood and it’s made of intestinal fluid that holds protein and fat. Your lymph nodes are formed in clusters throughout the body in areas like the centre of the chest, groin, the armpit and your neck. This system is a key player in the body’s immune system because it helps to move waste and toxins out of your tissues so that they’re flushed out. If the lymphatic system isn’t functioning properly, you’ll experience a variety of health issues. \r\n\r\nHow Do I Know If I Need Lymphatic Drainage Treatment?\r\n\r\nIf you’re experiencing any of the symptoms below, your body may be encountering toxin overload which means you could benefit from a lymphatic drainage massage.\r\n\r\n•Chronic sinus infections\r\n•Swelling in your fingers\r\n•Allergies\r\n•Depression\r\n•Food sensitivities\r\n•Swollen lymph nodes\r\n•Excess weight gain\r\n•Weakened immune system\r\n•Constipation\r\n•Bloat\r\n•Digestion issues\r\n•Brain fog\r\n•Chronic fatigue\r\n•Dry or itchy skin\r\n•TMJ",

            "description": "\r\nRenee Edwards Energy Healer\r\nEmotion Code Specialist Releasing Trapped Emotional Energy and  Heart walls relieving physical and emotional pain.\r\n\r\nEmotion Code is a very powerful modality which uses muscle testing to identify trapped emotions in the body and releases them with the use of a magnet. Negative emotions vibrate at a low frequency and can affect the surrounding tissues causing discomfort and pain or leading to disease.  They can also cause emotional symptoms and emotional blocks to achieving certain goals.  We can trap them in our body if we don&#39;t fully process an emotion we are feeling, if we absorb it from others, if we inherit it from our ancestors or carried it with us from past/parallel lives.  We also place trapped emotions around our heart creating walls for protection at times of conflict or trauma. This is called a Heart Wall.  If someone has a heart wall, which is about 93 % of the population, it affects our heart signals that are sent to and received from other people. This interferes with the way people give and receive love, as well as prevents them from following their heart.   It can also cause emotional numbness, sadness, and anxieties.  The heart wall also contributes to physical symptoms like tension and pain in the heart chakra area, (neck, shoulders, chest and back). When the heart wall is released, it opens one up to live more fully from their heart.  Releasing trapped emotions can result in experiencing a light feeling, like a weight has been lifted, more joy, less pain, tension and a reduction in anxieties and sadness.  ",

            "description": "Reiki procedure in dogs or cats.\r\nSince Reiki is not an operation, little will be necessary before an appointment with a holistic veterinarian. The animal reiki practitioner will ask you a few questions based on the animal’s general temperament, why you think reiki may be right for them, and if they have any parts of their body they especially don’t like touched. After the short conference, the reiki practitioner will take the dog to a peaceful, quiet space.\r\nFocus on Dog’s/Cat&#39;s Emotions and Energy\r\nDuring Reiki, the practitioner will begin by letting the animal sniff, lick, and get used to them. It’s essential that the animal invites this person to perform Reiki. In some cases, an animal may not want to be touched at all, in which the reiki practitioner will place their healing hands just inches away from the chakras of the body. Typically, the hands will begin at the crown chakra and work their way down, slowly, to the root chakra. However, particular attention may be given to specific chakras based on energy or request of the pet-owner. The session can last anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the process, the dog/cat&#39;s level of comfort, and request of the owner.\r\nEfficacy of Reiki in Dogs and cats.\r\nThe effectiveness of reiki is up to its receiver. If an animal is open to the process of Reiki, their ability to find peacefulness and expel nervous or negative energy will be exceptionally higher. Many pet owners and holistic veterinarians report seeing results in their animal&#39;s general temperament in as little as one to two weeks, with the sessions occurring at least 2-3 times a week. Often, holistic methods are more effective when combined with other methods, such as nutritional supplementation, proper diet, frequent exercise, and discussion with a trusted veterinarian. \r\n",

Their brains catalog things quickly; when they relax, they get a break from this cataloging.\r\nChildren who have dyslexia and dysgraphia usually have very quick, sharp minds, but they may have difficulty demonstrating what they know. For kids with dysgraphia, CST can reduce tension in the arms and hands, which makes the process of writing easier. Dyslexic kids often have difficulty processing visual and auditory information; CST can reduce tension patterns around the eyes and ears, so all areas of the brain that process language will function better.\r\n\r\nLooking to book an appointment for today?

Dermaplaning is a safe and simple skin rejuvenation treatment intended to exfoliate the epidermis and remove facial peach fuzz. It leaves the skin smoother and looking healthier. This exfoliation allows for your skincare products to penetrate more readily into the deeper layers.\r\n\r\nMicroneedling or collagen induction therapy generate micro-punctures in the skin and stimulates the collagen. It results in a smoother and more youthful appearance. The micropunctures create a controlled injury underneath the surface of the skin, which then sends a wake up call to the collagen to start producing more. The skin plumps and thickens in response to this. Microneedling aims to improve mild to moderate acne scarring, fine lines and wrinkles, rough skin texture, decreases pore size, and tightens lax skin and reduces hyperpigmentation.\r\n\r\n",

It can help to calm the nervous system and release tension, allowing patients to experience a greater sense of peace and relaxation.\r\n~Pain and symptom management: Cancer and its treatments can cause various physical symptoms such as pain, fatigue, nausea, and neuropathy. Oncology massage therapy can help alleviate these symptoms by reducing muscle tension, improving circulation, and promoting the release of endorphins, which are natural pain-relieving substances.\r\n~Improved sleep: Many cancer patients experience disruptions in their sleep patterns. Oncology massage can help promote better sleep by inducing relaxation, reducing anxiety, and relieving physical discomfort. Quality sleep is vital for the body&#39;s natural healing processes.\r\n~Emotional support: A cancer diagnosis and treatment can often bring about emotional distress, anxiety, and depression. Oncology massage therapy provides a safe space for patients to relax, express their emotions, and receive compassionate touch, which can help reduce feelings of isolation and provide emotional support.\r\n~Improved lymphatic flow: Some massage techniques used in oncology massage are specifically designed to support the lymphatic system, which plays a crucial role in immune function. Promoting healthy lymphatic flow can help reduce swelling (lymphedema) and support the body&#39;s natural detoxification process.\r\n",

Regular Massage Therapy can help you grow into your new body and reduce and manage uncomfortable symptoms.\r\n\r\nPregnancy massage is a great means of ensuring that your changing body adapts comfortably to your growing bundle of joy.\r\nMassage during pregnancy can help your body adjust to the changes of pregnancy. Helping you sleep better, allowing you to be more mobile and relax you mentally and physically. As you progress through pregnancy there is an increase in blood flow, increase in function of all your organs (heart, lung, liver) and of course the obvious tired, achy muscles. Massage therapy can help optimize your health and wellbeing during the entirety of your pregnancy.\r\n\r\nA typical massage session takes at least 60 minutes and you will be comfortably positioned on your side.\r\n",

Their brains catalog things quickly; when they relax, they get a break from this cataloging.\r\nChildren who have dyslexia and dysgraphia usually have very quick, sharp minds, but they may have difficulty demonstrating what they know. For kids with dysgraphia, CST can reduce tension in the arms and hands, which makes the process of writing easier. Dyslexic kids often have difficulty processing visual and auditory information; CST can reduce tension patterns around the eyes and ears, so all areas of the brain that process language will function better.\r\n\r\nLooking to book an appointment for today?

The continual movement of bodily fluids is also essential for maintaining well being. When this is not working, a state of congestion of circulation develops. This impairs the delivery of oxygen and nutrients and removal of waste products from the tissues which creates discomfort and pain. This often may be felt in an area not that closely associated to the original problem.\r\nOsteopathic practitioners use specialized skills to identify restrictions and tensions of the tissues in your body. Their specific techniques ease those restrictions, which allows for normal physiology to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking to book an appointment for today?  Call the spa for availability ",

Hypersensitive areas are treated by combining precisely directed depth, tension with very specific patient movements. RAPID sessions may be uncomfortable, this occurs as the neurological system is being stimulated to restore normal function. Clients choose RAPID because of the rapid response to treatment, and is ideal for both acute and chronic conditions. These sessions will take up to 30 min.

Similar to how veins and capillaries work to move blood through the circulatory system, the lymphatic system is a network of vessels that moves lymph from tissues to the bloodstream. Lymph is made of white blood cells that attack bacteria within the blood and it’s made of intestinal fluid that holds protein and fat. Your lymph nodes are formed in clusters throughout the body in areas like the centre of the chest, groin, the armpit and your neck. This system is a key player in the body’s immune system because it helps to move waste and toxins out of your tissues so that they’re flushed out. If the lymphatic system isn’t functioning properly, you’ll experience a variety of health issues. \r\n\r\nHow Do I Know If I Need Lymphatic Drainage Treatment?\r\n\r\nIf you’re experiencing any of the symptoms below, your body may be encountering toxin overload which means you could benefit from a lymphatic drainage massage.\r\n\r\n•Chronic sinus infections\r\n•Swelling in your fingers\r\n•Allergies\r\n•Depression\r\n•Food sensitivities\r\n•Swollen lymph nodes\r\n•Excess weight gain\r\n•Weakened immune system\r\n•Constipation\r\n•Bloat\r\n•Digestion issues\r\n•Brain fog\r\n•Chronic fatigue\r\n•Dry or itchy skin\r\n•TMJ",

Dermaplaning is a safe and simple skin rejuvenation treatment intended to exfoliate the epidermis and remove facial peach fuzz. It leaves the skin smoother and looking healthier. This exfoliation allows for your skincare products to penetrate more readily into the deeper layers.\r\n\r\nMicroneedling or collagen induction therapy generate micro-punctures in the skin and stimulates the collagen. It results in a smoother and more youthful appearance. The micropunctures create a controlled injury underneath the surface of the skin, which then sends a wake up call to the collagen to start producing more. The skin plumps and thickens in response to this. Microneedling aims to improve mild to moderate acne scarring, fine lines and wrinkles, rough skin texture, decreases pore size, and tightens lax skin and reduces hyperpigmentation.\r\n\r\n",

Thai Massage is a very individual experience in the hands of a skilled practitioner, each session is individually customized and tailored to meet specific client needs, ranging from relaxing, passive, slow palm massage for stress reduction, to an energetic, deep work massage using elbows and knees to apply stronger presses accompanied by stretching, tractions, and twists. Slow and rhythmic, each posture flows easily into the next. Mild, firm or strong touch techniques are applied to create a powerful, singular, healing experience. A relaxing and rejuvenating form of passive yoga, Tai Chi and Eastern massage techniques combined.\r\n\r\nClients are taken through a full range of motion resulting in an increased sense of well-being and stress relief while stimulating the detoxification process by balancing meridians. Sessions complement all body types and are tailored to the individual needs of each client in Toronto.\r\n\r\nIt is without oil and more pressure point, more deeper and harder withstretching",
